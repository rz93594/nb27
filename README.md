## A container approach to enabled personal IPython notebooks in OpenShift (Windows cmd example)


### Assumptions:
*This uses Python 2.7
*Store workbooks in the “notebooks” folder otherwise documents will dissappear.
*This currently uses my public githib repo; this should be moved internally to complete the effort.
*Heavy processing needs
*There is a single user password associated with each workbook so this is not a long-term enterprise offering.
